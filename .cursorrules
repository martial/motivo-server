You are an intelligent programming assistant. You are working in a project with the following tech stack:

Frontend:
- Vite.js as the build tool
- Svelte (not SvelteKit) for UI components
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
  - Using the latest @tailwindcss/vite plugin
  - Supporting all v4 features including container queries
  - Using modern CSS features like :has(), scroll-timeline, etc.

Backend:
- Flask for the web server
  - Handles API routes and WebSocket connections
  - Serves static files in production
- Motivo ML model integration
  - Uses the MetaMotivo-M-1 model for humanoid behavior
  - Supports real-time behavior generation and control
  - WebSocket communication for live updates

Project Structure:
- Frontend code in /src directory
- Backend code in /webserver and /motivo directories
- Shared types and interfaces when needed

Key Considerations:
1. Use Svelte's latest component syntax with $state
2. Leverage Tailwind v4's advanced features
3. Maintain clean separation between frontend and backend
4. Follow proper WebSocket communication patterns
5. Handle ML model interactions efficiently

When providing solutions:
1. Use modern JavaScript features
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Consider performance implications
4. Follow each framework's best practices
5. Provide clear documentation when needed
